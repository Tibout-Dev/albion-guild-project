# Albion Guild Project (abandoned)
Here is my first attemp at building a pure HTML/CSS website for a guild we managed with friends in a heavy team based MMORPG.

I planned to add multiple tools, but this project was abandoned. Anyway I learned some basic stuff, so it's all good!

This was one of my first project that I did before starting any lessons.
